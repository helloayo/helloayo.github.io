Rush is a San Francisco based vintage clothing brand. They needed a logo and hang tags for their wares. Because Rush is a play on gold rush, I chose a gold foil design, with the typography designed to invoke movement. 

This was a fun and interesting project to work on, as it gave me an opportuinity to learn about the clothing industry.
