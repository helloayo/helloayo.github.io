At Their Side is a patient health status update service. I was approached by the team to create marketing materials with different versions geared toward educating healthcare facilities and the families of patients about their app and services. 

For this project, I was given a logo, some screenshots and accompanying text. Since the material was geared towards healthcare professionals and families, I wanted to ensure the design was interesting enough to catch the eye without breaking from what is traditionally seen at these facilities. I utilized the logo colors to highlight important information and unify the material. I also created iphone mockups so clients could picture the app in use. 

Brochures and fliers like this always present interesting design challenges because there are large chunks of information that has to be conveyed in limited space. To work around the constraints, I used typography that was large yet set close enough to save space while maintaining legibility.
