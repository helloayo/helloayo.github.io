At eBay, I worked between two devolpment teams for the marketing vertical, developing emails and landing pages for promotions and consumer facing sites. The emails needed to be mobile responsive and cross-compatible with various email clients, browsers and  operating systems. Due to the nature of marketing campaigns, the work had to be turned around quickly and changes needed to be coded up until the launch time.
