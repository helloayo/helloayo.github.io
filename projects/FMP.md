Fletcher McLaurin, PLLC is a Houston based law firm that needed a professional logo, business cards and stationery. 

I created a design that was versatile enough to be used on various print materials. Keeping in mind that they would need to print the stationery and envelopes as needed in their office, I chose a black and white palette. I also chose a secondary font that was available on their systems so they would have a consistent look and feel when typing letters to clients. 

The challenge of this project was creating a design that was traditional yet bold, reflecting the personalities of the lawyers in this firm.
