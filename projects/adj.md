When my college roommate got engaged, she asked me to design her wedding invitations and accompanying material. I gladly helped her pick colors and we came up with a playful and funky design that reflected her personality. This was a fun project because I got to contribute to her wedding in a meaningful way. 

My favorite part of this project was creating a simplified map to the venue for the RSVPs.
