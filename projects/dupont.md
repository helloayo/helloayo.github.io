Dupont needed to overhaul their website, so I was brought onto to a small team tasked with coding the agency designs. My role was to develop the HTML and CSS for the consumer and investor relation websites, and to make the website responsive. For this project, I worked on both the Team Foundation Server and Drupal platforms using the Microsoft toolset, Visual Studio and ASP.NET.
