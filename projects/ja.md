Junior Achievement (JA) is a non-profit organization which helps children value free enterprise through educational programs. As part of Accentureâ€™s Skills to Succeed Corporate Citizenship work, I worked with a small team in developing a tablet app to compliment the new job skills curriculum. JA needed an educational app geared towards teens to teach them responsibility and problem solving at work. The app was concieved as a game set in an amusement park where teens could play a character that worked at the park and resoved issues. Play moved forward by watching instructional videos and answering quiz questions on the subjects presented.

I was tasked with developing the quiz functionality, the scoring mechanism, and the transitions for the app. Because we didn't have access to a database for the app, I utilized HTML5's Web Storage API to store session, scoring, and quiz data. I also created the technical design document and helped with unit testing  and environment builds. The app was developed using the following tools: Adobe Edge, Phonegap, JQuery, and  Twitter Bootstrap.

This was my first time developing an app and it was a challenging yet valuble learning experience. I was given a lot of freedom in choosing technical solutions for this project. I especially enjoyed experimenting with localStorage and sessionStorage to create a functioning game, and figuring out how to create a parallax and drag and drop layout that works on touch screens.

See the functionality of the drag and drop quiz I created [here.](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/helloayo/drag-and-drop/blob/master/index.html)
